# Heart Disease Prediction Using ML Algorithms and Advanced Preprocessing Techniques

This project applies multiple machine learning algorithms with advanced preprocessing techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease from patient data.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- Built using Python (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Includes advanced preprocessing:
  - Feature selection
  - Normalization & encoding
  - Handling class imbalance
- Evaluates models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Confusion matrix

##  Machine Learning Models Used

1. Logistic Regression  
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
4. Decision Tree Classifier  
5. Random Forest Classifier  
6. Gradient Boosting Classifier  
7. AdaBoost Classifier  
8. XGBoost Classifier  
9. Naive Bayes  

##  Goal

To compare multiple ML models and find the most accurate one for heart disease prediction.
